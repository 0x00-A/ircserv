# IRC Server Project README

**Internet Relay Chat (IRC)** is a network of Internet servers that enables real-time online conversations via PCs and other devices.

1. **Chat System for Instant Messaging**:
   - IRC is a **text-based chat system** designed for group communication.
   - It allows users to participate in **discussion forums** called channels.
   - Users can also engage in **one-on-one communication** through private messages.

2. **Client-Server Model**:
   - IRC operates on a **clientâ€“server networking model**.
   - Users connect to an **IRC server** using various clients (web apps, standalone desktop programs, or embedded components).
   - The server may be part of a larger **IRC network**.

3. **History**:
   - Created by **Jarkko Oikarinen** in August 1988.
   - Originated at the **University of Oulu in Finland**.
   - Initially intended to extend BBS software for real-time discussions and Usenet-style news.
   - The first IRC network ran on a single server named **tolsun.oulu.fi**.

4. **Features**:

## Bot Functionality
We've also implemented a bot with additional features:

   - Usage: `PRIVMSG bot :weather city`
   - The bot responds with weather information for the specified city.

2. **User Tracking and Blacklist**:
   - Invite the bot to a channel.
   - The bot can track users who use inappropriate language and maintain a blacklist.
   - Usage:
     - `PRIVMSG bot :#channel blacklist`: Manage the blacklist. (for operators only)
     - `PRIVMSG bot :#channel logtime`: Track users' time spent in the channel.

IRC remains a part of Internet history.
