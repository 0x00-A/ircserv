:Cannot join channel (+l) - channel is full, try again later

if someone join  a channel it is sent to all users not just operators also +o -o nick

the channel ceases to exist when the last client leaves it

Channels also contain a topic. The topic is a line shown to all users when they join the channel, and all users in the channel are notified when the topic of a channel is changed.

problem: if a user joined a channel and then changed the nick name the data in channels he is currently in is not updated


+ remove deconnected users from channels


if channel already exist (join)
